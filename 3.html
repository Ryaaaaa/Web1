  <p>Why do we need blockchain?
  Business transactions take place every second of every day — orders, payments, account tracking and much more.
  Often, each participant has his or her own ledger — and, thus, a version of the truth that may differ from other participants.
  These multiple ledgers can be a recipe for error, fraud and inefficiency.
  But because members on a blockchain share a common view of the truth,
  it’s now possible to see all details of a transaction end-to-end, reducing those vulnerabilities.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:30px;"><h3>Ordinary transactions are complex</h3>
  •  Each participant has his own, separate ledger — increasing the possibility of human error or fraud
  •  Reliance on intermediaries for validation creates inefficiencies
  •  Can become a paper-laden process, resulting in frequent delays and potential losses for all stakeholders</p>
  <p><h3>Blockchain reduces that complexity</h3>
  •  Single, shared, tamper-evident ledger — once recorded, transactions cannot be altered
  •  All parties must give consensus before a new transaction is added to the network
  •  Eliminates or reduces paper processes, speeding up transaction times and increasing efficiencies</p>
